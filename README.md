## General Contributing Rules

Whenever referring to another hero, another resource, always write them with the following rules:

-   Always lowercase
-   If name contains spaces, replace them for `-` (dash)
    -   E.g.: `Ruele of Light` (5 star Light hero) becomes `ruele-of-light`
-   If name contains `'` (apostrophe) or any other special symbol (that is, not `a-zA-Z0-9`, and not a greek word, see rule below), simply ignore it.
    -   E.g.: `Water's Origin` (4 star artifact) becomes `waters-origin`.
-   If name contains greek special symbol (that is, `β`), write it's greek name ([reference letter->name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_alphabet#Sound_values)). Some other games have items of same name with different greek letter so let's prepare for that.
    -   E.g.: `Abyss Guide β` (Item that gives entries to Abyss dungeon) becomes `abyss-guide-beta`.
